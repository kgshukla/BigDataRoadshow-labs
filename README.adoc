= Pivotal Big Data Roadshow  - Hands-on Technical Workshop

So far this consists of:

* this README
* link:labs/springxd[Data Streaming with Spring XD, GemFire and PHD]
* link:labs/phd-hawq[PHD and Hawq Overview Lab]
* link:labs/gemfire[GemFire Overview Lab (optional)]  

== Environment

The labs are built for running on any environment with the right products installed.  
In order to make it simpler, we've created the Amazon AMI to launch instances quickly. There is no .pem requirement to login in to the EC2 instance once AMI is launced.

<TODO - AMI reference>
